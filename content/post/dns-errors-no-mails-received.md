Due to an error in the nameserver configuration I did not receive any email to any of my domains (onlinetrust.de, sebastiansteins.com, seb.st) within the last 2 hours (since 2014-16-09 10:14 CEST).
Due to caching, that problem may persist a few hours.

**Mails should not have been lost** (if your mail server is configured correctly), but may reach me with a delay of a few hours!

For urgent notifications, please contact me at sebastian.steins@gmail.com!

Sorry for the inconvenience!

*[Update **2014-09-16 14:18 CEST**]: DNS settings seem to be correct for most open DNS servers now. However, a delay for some ISPs cannot be excluded at the moment.*

*[Update **2014-09-16 15:40 CEST**]: Mails start dripping in for all domains mentioned above. I expect the issue to be solved. If you think there is still a problem reaching me, use my gmail in urgent cases!*
