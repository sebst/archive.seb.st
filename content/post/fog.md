![Fog!](/content/images/2014/Sep/nebel.jpg)

I just found a nice little picture in my old backups. The picture is from December, 2006. Brwosing in old and forgotten backups always come up with those ambitious feelings between "oh, what the hell have I done then?" and "to be honest, I should have won a prize for that one". 

If you're wondering: The fog picture is something in between.

I hope to find the hi-res version of this photo and to revive my love for photography.

Btw, I am just wondering if finding an old hard disk and feel a bit nostalgic will disappear over time as cloud storage emerges. Would be a bad thing!
