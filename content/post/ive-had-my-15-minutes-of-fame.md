Yes, this blog got [mentioned on HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8344668). It was even position one for a short time!

![screen short of this blog on position one in hacker news](/content/images/2014/Sep/hacker_news.png)

It was Saturday, around 8pm CEST, when the [blog post about Google+](http://seb.st/google-stops-forcing-you-to-join-google-when-opening-a-new-account/) made it to the front page. 

It may have felt like [this](https://medium.com/this-happened-to-me/how-does-it-feel-to-make-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-6cb25373b03e). However, I am happy I had dinner with my girlfriend in the city when the hell broke over my web server stats, so I noticed the impact not till I came back home. Basically, I had my 15 mins of fame which peaked to roughly 600 visitors per hour and did not really notice.

A special thing is that I naively submitted my short article to Hacker News with my 4 days old [account](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sebst). If you came here with the question of how to get to the front page of hacker news in your mind, the answer is simple: Stick to the [rules](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html). A piece of interesting, up-to-date and open-for-discussion content will help, either.
