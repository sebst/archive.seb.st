During the latest session of [HackForHealth](http://hackforhealth.be) I have been team  captain of the MINDSET team.

Together, we won the challenge with [this presentation](http://slideshare.net/onvaleo/mindset-hackforhealth-presentation).

[MINDSET](http://mindset.is) will be a tool for [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) treatment for children by leveraging [Neuofeedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback). The idea is to create a game store for fun games with integrated Neurofeedback sessions. A first prototype could be based on the [OpenBCI](http://www.openbci.com/) hardware.
