Health Care and Life Sciences are amongst the most regulated sectors of the world.

The way modern health care systems work is strongly influenced by different gate-keeping systems. Big pharma mostly thinks of "blockbuster pills", leaving people suffering from orphan diseases alone, most of the time. Also, customized medicine does not fulfill the patterns the industry got used to for centuries.

New technology and digitalization can bring health care to a new level. 

For this to happen, we need to connect Big Pharma and other players to motivated entrepeneurs. This will happen during [innovate.healthcare](http://innovate.healthcare) where we try to focus on solutions to health care of the future.

The event will take place from June, 19 till June, 21 in Cologne, Germany. Stay tuned for updates!
