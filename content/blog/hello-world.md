**Hello, world!** 

This is my ghost blog. That should not mean that I am not going to post but refers to a [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) based blogging platform: [ghost](https://ghost.org).

You may also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebastiansteins).

Since I have been online since the (late) [90s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s) *(remember this funny sounds of  your modem?)*, I will try to upload some content to seb.st which I created in the last decades and consider to be still relevant, for example some stuff about [technical details of telephone hardware in Germany](/kab/) or [standard disclaimers on German websites](/docs/lgh.html).
