**Hi stranger!** You found something with this web address on it? Odds, are, that's mine! 

Of course, I want it back. And I will give you a reward! 

Please send me an email to [sebastian.steins@gmail.com](mailto:sebastian.steins@gmail.com?subject=I found your thing)!

**Thank you for being so honest!**

<!--<small>Btw, is it nerdy to find it funny that [/lostphone](/lostphone) replies with `200 Found`?</small>-->
